GraphQL is a query language which gives the client the power to ask for exactly what they need.

query {
    catgory(id:1) {
        name
        products {
            image
            name
        }
    }
}

това, което казваме тук е: намери категория по ID, върни името на категорията заедно с масива products, от които искам само image and name;

when we create a GraphQL server, we have to specify two things. the type definitions or in other words the schema and the resolver.
The Schema is the way that our data is going to look; the way our query is going to look, the way that our mutations are going to look, it's just the way that we specify how our data looks like.
The resolvers are actual functions that return the data that conforms to the way that we specify them in the schema.

Scalar types: String, Integet, Float, Boolean

the resolver has three parameters that we can utilize: parent, args, context
